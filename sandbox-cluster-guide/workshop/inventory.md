# Inventory

What you should have:

 * 2 [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
 * 2 [Micro-USB cable](http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=103&cp_id=10303&cs_id=1030307&p_id=4867&seq=1&format=2) (the cable you would use to charge an Android phone)
 * 2 [microSD cards with adapters](http://www.newark.com/transcend/tsraspi10-16g/memory-microsdhc-uhs-1-class-10/dp/77Y6534)
 * 2 [HDMI-to-DVI cables](http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=102&cp_id=10231&cs_id=1023104&p_id=2661&seq=1&format=2)
 * 1 [Ethernet cable](http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=102&cp_id=10208&cs_id=1020802&p_id=2128&seq=1&format=2)
 * 1 USB keyboard 
 * 1 USB Mouse
 * 1 [5-port USB charger](https://amzn.com/B00IBDOB5I) (shared)
 * 2 LCD panels

For previous generations Raspberry Pis you'll need one or two
[USB WiFi adapters](https://amzn.com/B003MTTJOY). To build a larger
cluster you'll need a switch to connect the Ethernet interfaces, some
more Ethernet cables and LCD panels (one for each Pi). For a
small cluster (say 4 nodes) I like the
[NETGEAR ProSAFE FS105NA 5-Port Fast Ethernet Switch (FS105NA)](https://amzn.com/B00002EQCW);
it's inexpensive (partially because it only goes at 100Mbps which all
Raspberry Pis can do) and the metal case stands up to some rough handling.
