# Raspberry Pi Cluster Workshop Agenda

This workshop will show you how to build a cluster using two Raspberry Pis. You can build the cluster using more Raspberry Pis, but we're keeping things simple so that we don't need a network switch.

The repository with all the workshop materials and example
applications is at:<br>
