# Parallel Programming

How can make these cores, processors, and computers work together? What examples can I look at?

* Shared vs. distributed memory.
* Many tools for parallel and distributed communications.
* Also threading within a task
* Race conditions!

## Pygame 

Many of our examples use [Pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) to
drive the visual aspects and any game logic. It's simple and great for
other introductory programming classes or projects.
