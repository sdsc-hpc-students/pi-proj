## Supercomputers & High-Perfomance Computing

Why supercomputers?

## Parallel Programming

* Shared memory or distributed memory? When don't pointers work?
* What is parallel programming?
* Distributed computing?
* Any other examples of parallel computing?

## Raspberry Pis

[Details about the Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-3-specs-benchmarks/)

There are a ton of great resources for learning about Raspberry Pis for education, but the best place to start is the [Raspberry Pi Learning Resources](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/). These pages cover all the introductory material, links to community pages, and several simple and well-organized lessons. Here are some of the ones we suggest you look at to get started:

* [What is a Raspberry Pi?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/)
* [A Teachers' Guide to Using Raspberry Pi in the Classroom](https://www.raspberrypi.org/guides/teachers/)
* [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Lesson](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-lesson/)

For advanced students many of the skill necessary are covered by the
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/). This group helps
scientists and engineers that are new to scientific computing learn
the basics about Linux, version control, data, and software
development. [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
is helpful if you're not familiar with the command line on Linux.
